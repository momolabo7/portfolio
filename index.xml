&lt;p&gt;Like Fallout 1, I have also played Fallout 2 as a kid. Just like Fallout 1, it's so refreshing to play it in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fallout 1</title><link>/blog/reviews/20221117_fallout_1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 14:44:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/blog/reviews/20221117_fallout_1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I played Fallout 1 in 2022 and here are my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let me give a disclaimer and say that I have played Fallout 1 as a kid when the game is still in a CD.
I remember positive emotions playing the game but all I remembered as an adult before playing it again was that you are the Vault Dweller from Vault 13 and you need to find a water chip within some kind of a time limit.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Stray</title><link>/blog/reviews/20220731_stray/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 13:40:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/blog/reviews/20220731_stray/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I just played this game called 'Stray' over the week just to check out what all the hype was about.
Before I go on, I would like to say that it's a pretty decent game.
I can see why there are people who loved and hate it.
Here I'm just going to pen down thoughts I find about the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously though, I remembered liking the previous site design.
A year later, however, I just couldn't look at it straight in the eye anymore.
Perhaps it's because I developed a stronger opinion on what I want my site to be.

&lt;p&gt;Momoko became a skilful conjurer, but had several disagreements with the Twin Adders Grand Company governing Gridania and the Conjurer's Guild including the White Mages.

Heya! Welcome to my little slice of the internet. I hope you like what I did to this website, I had fun coding and designing it!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Oh right, about myself. I'm Momo! If you can't already tell from the website's design, programming is my bread and butter. I am born, raised and happily married in hot tropical Singapore (which really isn't that hot since it's almost sheltered everywhere).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I graduated from DigiPen Institute of Technology Singapore in 2013 with a Bachelor in Computer Science in Game Design (what a mouthful). I worked in the games industry for 6 years and am currently teaching programming and software development project modules in my alma meter. Notably, I had some experience living and working in Japan as a games developer. Even though I had no professional experience as a game designer, I do have tons of opinions about game design in general, having worked with many game designers both as a developer and a teacher.

&lt;h1 id="where-is-gerald-physically"&gt;Where is Gerald physically?&lt;/h1&gt;



Gerald is currently in Singapore!

&lt;div id="countdown"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
 // Set the date to count down to (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
 const countDownDate = new Date("2023-06-03T00:00:00").getTime();

 // Update the countdown every second
 const countdownTimer = setInterval(function() {

 // Get the current date and time
 const now = new Date().getTime();

 // Calculate the remaining time
 const distance = countDownDate - now;

 // Calculate days, hours, minutes, and seconds
 const days = Math.floor(distance / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
 const hours = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)) / (1000 * 60 * 60));
 const minutes = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 60 * 60)) / (1000 * 60));
 const seconds = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 60)) / 1000);

 // Construct the remaining time string
 const countdownString = `${days} days ${hours} hours ${minutes} mins ${seconds} seconds`;
 

 // Set the text of the countdown div to the remaining time string
 document.getElementById("countdown").innerText = "Gerald will be in Japan in: " + countdownString;

 // If the countdown is finished, display a message
 if (distance &lt; 0) {
 clearInterval(countdownTimer);
 document.getElementById("countdown").innerText = "";
 }
 }, 1000);
&lt;/script&gt;
