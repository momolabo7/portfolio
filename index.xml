&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not really good at reading copious amount of text in games, but this game had me hooked in reading. I liked how the game lead you through many different kinds of rabbit holes to figure out different details of each character from different angles of writing. For examples, we can start searching for someone on the web, then turns out they have a different article in a local newspaper that exposes more of their background, and another different article on a business magazine that exposes their business dealings.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Rise of the Golden Idol</title><link>/gamedev/20250118_rise_of_the_golden_idol_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/gamedev/20250118_rise_of_the_golden_idol_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was looking back at my &amp;ldquo;Case Of The Golden Idol&amp;rdquo; review and I was astounded that it was written in 2023!
Anyway, the developers apparently decided to release a new game (not a DLC!) due to popular demand and I immediately bought it to give it a shot.
Spoilers ahead!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reflecting on 2024</title><link>/yaps/20250111_reflecting_2024/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/yaps/20250111_reflecting_2024/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was considering posting this on social media or my own private journal but I decided to post this here which is&amp;hellip; kind of public but not really.

I&amp;rsquo;m momo, but you can also call me moom!
It&amp;rsquo;s a little messy but feel free to make yourself comfortable and take a look around!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some facts about me:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m from Singapore!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I love programming and make my computer go &lt;em>beep boop&lt;/em>!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>My main programming languages are C/C++, Python and Javascript.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I can speak English, Japanese and Mandarin.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I love music and can play the piano&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m happily married &amp;lt;3&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m easily distracted, play too many games and have too many hobbies. You might might find scraps of my interests lying around so watch your step!&lt;/li>
