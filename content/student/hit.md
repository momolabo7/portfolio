**Heavy Indestructable Tanks** is a multiplayer party game inspired by. You are a Tank, and you are Indesctructable. However, your enemies are too! Fire at their feet and sink the ground under them till nothing is left beneath them; that will ensure their fate.
              
This game is a GAM150 student project written by a team of 4 for Digipen Institute of Technology, Singapore. The game is mostly coded from ground up using C/C++. Only the FMOD library is used.
              
My responsibilities as a Tech Lead include:
* Wrote the physics and collision systems, including spatial partitioning
* Implemented menus, UI and sound systems
* Implemented the AI of the game
* Code documentation 

The game is current not avaliable online. Maybe once I find the source code, I will do something about it ;).
