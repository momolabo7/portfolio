*you notice a shelf filled with books and papers in messy scribbles*

"those? just some scribbles you can read, i don't mind."

*you look at the books curiously*

"they are mostly about [games](./gamedev), some [tech](./tech) stuff and the occassional [rant](./yap)"

*a laugh*

"sometimes it's fun to look back at what i was thinking and shake my head"
