This game...

<!--more-->

I think it started off well with the first few chapters.

Then there were really mind numbing chapters like the ones that parodied old F2P games which didn't really age well. 

Then it finished off decently. 

I can appreciate what the developers want to do with the game, and it started off so well that the middle part felt extremely disappointing. 

Also, I think the narrator talks WAY too much.

Sad.

5/10.
