Now that Silksong is out, I thought I'll do a trip back in memory lane and review the original Hollow Knight.

<!--more-->

My feelings for Hollow Knight are honestly similar to Celeste but with a much bigger looming sense of despair and awe. It's the kind of game that makes me wonder what I'm doing with my life.

The game is absolutely breathtaking, and has such an incredible attention to detail put into...everything that it's just impossible to list them. Art, sound, theme, lore, gameplay, story, challenge, level design, characters...you name it, this game does it all.

... 

Yeah. 

...

To be honest, I was mulling over what to write for this article for the past couple of days and I'm truely drawing a blank. It got me thinking a bit.

Do I not have anything to say because I think it is perfect? Is it because it is well within expectations? Is it because it does not do anything new in terms of innovation? 

It could just be all of the above. 

Either way, this game gets a 10/10 from me!

Also I think it's cool that the studio is based in Australia.
