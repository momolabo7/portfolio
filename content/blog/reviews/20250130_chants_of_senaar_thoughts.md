I was actually mildly stressed out writing this lol. I felt that there's just so much I wanted to say in the moments of playing the game that...words just fail me. But here goes.

Where do I even start? 

Do I even want to start?

I could break things down to individual components, but I felt that my attempt will not do the game any justice. It's not that any particular component is great or anything, it's how everything comes together and not a single item in the game is wasted. It is very difficult for me to say if there is anything the game needs to do better. Sure they can have more polygons and better graphics but...do they need to?

I guess one thing I can say that even though the game's levels are structured traditionally, they were not lazy in making sure that every event and discovery in each level is interesting and meaningful. It was awesome to go from "what are they saying?" to "oh, maybe they are saying this because I learnt some words" to "Ohhh they are not saying that; they are saying THIS!". Somehow this creates a loop around the level. You start going through the level clueless, and after you found some clues, you can circle back to the start of the level and fully understand what's actually happening!

Someone in my chat while I was streaming said that it's a "foreigner simulator" haha, and it's so true! You come in without knowing the language of each group in each level, then slowly you learn their language, what the people and their history are, and eventually understand them.

AND at the end, you help unify them by being their translator! And you get to see the fruits of your labour! It was awesome.

This is a very clear 10/10 game for me. Amazing game. Must play!
