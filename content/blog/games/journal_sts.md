* Act 1.
    * Boss: Turtle
    * Neow Bonus: Lose all god, get rare card: Took Thunder Strike over Seek and Barrier.
    * Found early Melter and Streamline. I think...Melter should be good for turtle...?
    * Elite: Laguvivi. Thunder Strike seem so bad atm. Streamline and Melter+ are doing work.
    * Found Pen Nib.
    * Found Recursion. I think there's synergy with Thunder Strike??
    * Sentries: Got really slow. Thunder Strike still not pulling weight...
    * Took Consume. Not really sure if it's a good idea.
    * Beat Turtle. Not a bad fight. Took Echo Form. Took Runic Dome (kinda need the energy)
* Act 2.
    * Died to Knight and Mage. Consume is probably a bad card. Thunder Strike too. Not enough block.

* Act 1.
    * Boss: Slime.
    * Took Leap and Equlibrum. Deck is probably good at blocking, just need to find more damage now.
    * Took Golden Idol. Had the thought that Defect doesn't care too much about Max HP.
    * Found Shuriken and...I wonder if that's a sign to go for more attack cards.
    * Wtf found Pen Nib. Now I'm confused. 
    * Took attack cards like Sweeping Beam, the Lock on one and the 0-cost Vuln one. Fights feel good. I think card draw is kind of an issue now. 
    * Boss fight: Slime was insanely easy. Took Philosopher's Stone. More energy to play more cards yey.

* Act 2.
    * Boss: Collector.
    * To be honest, I didn't know what kind of decisions I was making. It was all a blur but I took reprogramming and it seems to carry itself. I mistakenly thought that Focus = Orb Slot but clearly that was wrong lol. I also I think that I realized that this kind of deck actually wants Plasma orbs. Now there are some dead cards in my hand like Zap and Cold Snap (which was a REALLY bad mistake for this kind of deck).
    * Barely beat Collector. The dead cards mentioned just now was really getting in the way and I am lacking good card draw. Took Hyperbeam.

* Act 3:
    * Boss: Donuts
    * Hyperbeam is so funny on Reptomancer
    * Okay I manage to find Fusion+ and Stack+ and Hologram+. I think card draw is weak but we do have 2 Compile Drivers so it's not too bad.
    * Hyperbeam > Hologram > Hyperbeam is so stupid
    * Beat the Donuts

* Act 1.
    * Neow bonus: Rare card. Took Immolate.
    * Boss: Slime
    * Found "Feel no Pain".
    * Elite: Laguvivi. Wasn't too bad with Duliplcation potion on Immolate. Found Singing Bowl. 
    * Found the ugrade all cards card thing at merchant. 
    * Elite: Sentries. I had Feel no Pain so didn't feel much pain.
    * Ran into a super high value merchant. Paper Phrog, Oddly Smooth Strong. Juggernaut on discount, Pommel Strike, Shockwave. I *feel* like Shockwave + Paper Phrog is crazy, but it's not exactly good against Slime Boss. Juggernaut sounds insane too with FNP. Took Juggernaut, Pommel Strike, Shockwave and Stone.
    * Boss: Was a bit tight but managed to survive. Card choices are Fiend Fire, Corruption and Feed. I kind of feel like going for Feed just because I have Singing Bowl. I also have Headbutt so that I can find it easier I guess. Took Feed. Relic took Slaver's collar over the anti-potion energy one. Not fure if bad choice and going through Act 2's hallway fights might get me killed.
* Act 2
    * As expected. Died at hallway fight. They are too painful. Maybe I should've not be an idea and force hallway fights.

* Act 1. 
    * Boss is Hexaghost.
    * Neow: chose upgrade card. Upgraded Bash.
    * Selected a hallway fight heavy path. 
    * Took early Clothesline and Pommel Strike. Cleave was offered but not sure if it's takable. Felt like the decision can make or break the run. I feel like it's too much to hope for anything better (Immolate and Whirlwind), so I decided to take it.
    * Was offered Spot Weakness vs Armaments vs Hemokinesis. Argh it's tough but I think Spot Weakness is needed to make the rest of the deck viable later. 
    * Elite: sentry. Drank all my potions for this. Still took lots of damage sadly. Dark Embrace vs Shrug It Off vs Wild Strike. Feels like I need to take Dark Embrace but I decided to take Wild Strike to take more advantage of upgraded Bash.
    * Found Demon Form and Vajra?? Ok I think Hexaghost is solved. Figured I need more block now.
    * Elite: Grelim Nob. Noted how good Clothesline really is here. Presented with Inflame but I wasn't sure how much Strength is too much Strength. 
    * Lack of block cards is scaring me. Upgraded Clothesline for mitigation.
    * Chose to upgrade Demon Form instead of resting for last rest spot.
    * Died. Argh. Not enough block. Maybe I should've rested.

_This entry is incomplete because I accidentally deleted it!_

Act 1. Boss is Slime. Started early with Inflame. Early shop gave me discounted Sword Boomerang and immediately took it because of Strength synergy. Was contemplating buying Uppercut for awhile but ended up buying. Uppercut turns out to be a really good choice.

Had to choose between Fire Breathing and Impervious. Gut feeling says Impervious but took Fire Breathing thinking that it's good against Slime boss. 

Found Wild and Pommel strike midgame. Fire Breathing seems decent so far. Felt extremely strong and easily beat Laguvivi and Gremlin Nob. Sentries were surprisingly troublesome since I didn't have scaling block. Fire Breathing helped clean up the fight but didn't help for the first 3 turns where I took damage. Makes me think about Evolve against Sentries...it would run into similar problems.

Anger came. Hestitant picking it but turns out it was a good choice especially since I have Bash + Uppercut taking up too much energy.

Got really lucky at Slime Boss; when it split, the 2 slimes did not attack me for one round. Fire breathing really helped here as expected. Card reward was between Corruption, Exhume and Bludgeon. Didn't have any card to Exhume so went for Corruption. Relic chosen is the 2 wound one over the no gold one. Starting to think that Evolve+ will be insane.

Act 2. Boss is Collector. Took the Apparition cards from event. Bought Shuriken. Did not go for JAX cards (went for mutagen relic instead). Found Power Through and started to pray hard for Evolve. Fire Breathing is starting to shine here.

Manage to find Dark Embrace, Evolve, Headbutt and Armaments. Found the upgrade all strike/defends event (which I did since I did not remove any). Fight were becoming a walk in the park including elites. Noted that Apparition is seriously stupid against Reptomancer. Collector boss fight was easy thanks to Apparition stalling and Fire Breathing getting rid of the adds timely. Boss card found is Reaper. 

Act 3 was mostly a breeze. Last boss was Donut. I found Limit Break but to be honest the deck is already insane enough to clear the Donut, though I think against heart, it is the right card to take.
