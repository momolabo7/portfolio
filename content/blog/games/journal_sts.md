IronClad | A15 | 51MVKC2DUY40S | Won without heart

_This entry is incomplete because I accidentally deleted it!_

Act 1. Boss is Slime. Started early with Inflame. Early shop gave me discounted Sword Boomerang and immediately took it because of Strength synergy. Was contemplating buying Uppercut for awhile but ended up buying. Uppercut turns out to be a really good choice.

Had to choose between Fire Breathing and Impervious. Gut feeling says Impervious but took Fire Breathing thinking that it's good against Slime boss. 

Found Wild and Pommel strike midgame. Fire Breathing seems decent so far. Felt extremely strong and easily beat Laguvivi and Gremlin Nob. Sentries were surprisingly troublesome since I didn't have scaling block. Fire Breathing helped clean up the fight but didn't help for the first 3 turns where I took damage. Makes me think about Evolve against Sentries...it would run into similar problems.

Anger came. Hestitant picking it but turns out it was a good choice especially since I have Bash + Uppercut taking up too much energy.

Got really lucky at Slime Boss; when it split, the 2 slimes did not attack me for one round. Fire breathing really helped here as expected. Card reward was between Corruption, Exhume and Bludgeon. Didn't have any card to Exhume so went for Corruption. Relic chosen is the 2 wound one over the no gold one. Starting to think that Evolve+ will be insane.

Act 2. Boss is Collector. Took the Apparition cards from event. Bought Shuriken. Did not go for JAX cards (went for mutagen relic instead). Found Power Through and started to pray hard for Evolve. Fire Breathing is starting to shine here.

Manage to find Dark Embrace, Evolve, Headbutt and Armaments. Found the upgrade all strike/defends event (which I did since I did not remove any). Fight were becoming a walk in the park including elites. Noted that Apparition is seriously stupid against Reptomancer. Collector boss fight was easy thanks to Apparition stalling and Fire Breathing getting rid of the adds timely. Boss card found is Reaper. 

Act 3 was mostly a breeze. Last boss was Donut. I found Limit Break but to be honest the deck is already insane enough to clear the Donut, though I think against heart, it is the right card to take.
