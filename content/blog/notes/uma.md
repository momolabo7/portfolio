# Aptitude
---

* Track affects acceleration
* Distance affect speed
* Style affects wit but NOT skill activation rate

# Stats
---

## Speed

* Affects top velocity at last spurt.
* Getting blocked limits speed to uma in front
* Remember: Distance aptitude affects speed

## Stamina

* Affects max endurance (like HP).  HP is burnt constantly. No HP = burning out, which means your uma just cannot really run
* HP recovery skills recover based on Max HP and length of race. Recovery skills can also be seen as compensation for lack of Stamina stat.
* Requirement to clear URA:
    * Sprint: 0
    * Mile: 300+
    * Mid: 450+
    * Long: 550+

## Power

* Affects caleration cap and ability of change lanes
* Reduces Speed reduction when running uphill
* Later positions need more power to overtake and avoid getting boxed in
* Track aptitude affects acceleration!

## Guts

* Terrible?
* Revisit in future?
* It does provide speed and power at the same time though.

## Wits

* Affects skill activation rate:
    * 300 = 70%
    * 400~500 = 80%
    * 600+ = 90%
* Affects how likely uma will "Rush".
    * Rush means 1.6x HP consumption, abandon strat and...do stupid shit
* There's other non-important stuff like allowing your uma to take advantage of downhills better (lower HP consumption).

# Strategy
---

## Front Running

* Determines the pace of the race, ie HP consumption of all other horses
* Speed >> Wit > Power; Stamina depending on distance
* Wit quite important because they want to activate skills to move forward better and avoid rushing.


## Pace Chasers

* Speed >> Power
* Stamina as needed by distance but want 10% more than others because they have worst stamina to Hp conversion (by 11%)
* Drains HP the least though.
* Straightforward. 

## Late Surger

* Speed > Power
* Most likely to get blocked
* Best stamina to HP conversion
* Must have power to accelerate and overtake
* High risk, high reward

## End Close

* Same as Late Surger but they have good skills.
