# Ironclad

* Always have at least a way to get Strength. 
* Always look for exhaust synergy. Remember that exhausted cards don't matter if the enemies are dead.
* Average card pool quality is bad, so try to avoid Transforms.

# Silent

* 3 main archetypes to build towards: 
    * Poison (broken and easy)
    * Playing infinite cards (lots of draws, retains and energy)
    * Shiv
* Front loaded damage options are mostly bad, but need to take them for Act 1. Maybe avoid Act 1 Elites if high quality skill card appears early that we *must* take? 


# Defect
    
* Playing around frost orbs seems to be good idea
* Orb damage is random, i.e. MUCH weaker vs multiple mobs
