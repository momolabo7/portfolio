In this game, the context is that the MC discovered a book that instantly hypnotizes the target. He's in a club with a girl who is his childhood friend, where they collect occult items. This girl is cute, bubbly always teasing him.

# Scenes with triggers in the game:
---

* "Fall in love with first person you see waking up". It didn't seem to work at first, but the girl kissed him and tried to find excuses for doing that. It's rather cute! 

* "When you wake up, you will return to your usual self, sit on the chair, internally count to 0 and return to hypnotic state". This actually sounds fun and it's really hot! I think returning to normal self, doing a task and returning to hypnotic state for further instructions is interesting base to work with!

* "Whenever I count to 0, return to hypnotic state". Pretty standard.


* "Body (and emotions) will move as I say." The MC played around with this and made her lift her legs and be in a strange position where her legs are open and lifted. Girl was shocked. Then MC made it so that she becomes unable to feel strange of embarassment. Girl is no longer shocked, to the point where MC says that he can see her panties, she is okay with that.


##  Route 1


* Cannot stop laughing trigger. MC added that once the laughter has died down, she will fill in love with the person she laughed at and "express her greatest show of affection". Apparently her greatest show of affection is to taunt and insult him, THEN gave him a huge kiss. 

* Becoming horny while in trance. Sensitivity play.

* Imagines that she's in a shower, using shoe as showerhead.

* Did a "scripted scene" trigger. MC made the girl find me irresistable to the point of being jealous and wanting to know his feelings, made her think of using the book to extract his feelings, made her use the book on him and when he confesses with her full him, made her extremely horny. There's some elements of buildup here which is interesting from a storywriting perspective. Also they got together after this scene.

* "Become hornier and 'dirtier' and less embarassed and thinking it's wrong when I snap my fingers" trigger. MC keeps testing her resistance as he keeps snapping his fingers.

* Made her forget the book exists. MC also added hypnotic trigger.

* MC hypnotizes girl in the middle of the street and made her look natural as she's under trance. 

* "Always refer yourself as 'boku'". It's kind of like the "ending sentence with nya" triggers. 

* Made her unable to make a sound but not notice it.

* Made it so that no matter what MC says, it will sound like sweet loving words. MC then insults and says demeaning things to her. This is actually interesting...? Maybe an extension is to have the girl repeat why she thinks what MC says is sweet?

* "Whenever I say you are cute, you will run to the nearby tree, touch it and come back with a smile as if it's a normal thing to do"

* Hypnotized the girl to buy a sexy underwear when she can while on a date.

* Sensation play scene? MC made the girl strip naked and rewind time as if she just entered the room. Scene acts out as before but girl eventually notices and gets embarassed. MC then makes girl so sensitive and believe that wearing clothes while being this sensitive is bad.

* In trance, count to 10, when she reaches 10 she will orgasm.

* Becoming a cat.

* Story wise, MC had non-consensual sex (to a certain extent). She got mad at this point and wanted to prohibit sex. From here on, MC seems to want to play pranks to get back at her using hypnosis.

* Trigger that makes her think that she's dressed naughtily for a brief period every time the teacher tells everyone to turn a page during lesson. She also gets increasingly horny.

* Trigger that makes it so that the more she wants sex, she the more she will wear the naughtiest underwear to school. This is wear she discovers the underwear she bought without realizing it.


## Route 2

* Emotion and body control-play till orgasm while in trance. Nothing much here.

* Whenever she says MC's full name, she will feel horny.

* "When you wake up, you will definitely do anything I say as if it's natural, and you don't be bothered by it." This was interesting because MC went to ask her to "forget" what happened, which normally people can't. MC also went ahead to ask her to honestly answer his questions (like her crush), get her to not get embarassed, got her to kiss him

* Gave a trigger to go into trance.

* Doll-play. Made her strip while in trance. And have sex.

* Embarssment removal while in trance, then asked to answet honestly (masterbation, etc).

* Massaging her while naked; she doesn't notice anything strange. She also says normally embarassing things without hesitation.

* Masterbation without realizing MC is around. Then I think there's corruption play? To make the girl surrender her body to MC? MC added a trigger "becoming my thing" which causes her to obey him.

* Turn her into a doll and went out to a date. Made her buy a sexy underwear. 

* Made her unable to make a loud sound but made her very sensitive and come in public.

* If you think of sex and become horny you will appear naked to yourself.

* When she wears a cat costume, she becomes a cat.

* Makes her think that she might be a cat or something. She starts having cat-like thoughts, being in heat, etc. She thinks she has a tail and thinks she's sick and asks for help. MC explains the sickness and she believed everytihng.

* Whenever she wears cat ears, she will become a cat.

## Omake

* MC makes her follow his commands. She returns to normal at some point. MC accidentally went "put your hands down" and suddenly her hands feel heavy. MC then realizes what happened. MC adds trigger word to sleep and tests it. Usual stuff.

* MC suggests that as she was about to leave, she will deep kiss him (she will realize it after).

* Girl was embarrassed about the kiss the next day. When confronting MC, MC hypnotizes her and asks her questions about the kiss and her feelings (while in trance). 

* MC hypnotizes her to do whatever he says. He also makes it so that whenever he says "it's obvious" and any embarassment will be gone.

* MC makes her talk about the kiss (she gets embarassed but talks about it). He makes her think that kissing between friends is obvious.

* She wants coffee. MC makes it so that coffee smell makes her horny and think of dirty things. MC asks alot of personal questions (she answers them hesitantly, but I'm not sure how this fits in the scenario). MC makes it so that it feels good to answer questions. At some point she feels 'hot'. MC makes it so that taking off clothes is 'obvious'. She started doing...horny things with him. MC makes her forget everything but remembers the pleasure.

* MC makes her love him. MC makes her remember the pleasure she had with him the previous day. MC makes it so that she becomes horny but cannot cum and lets her go about her day. Basically corruption play. (Girl masterbated one night all night until she fainted)

* Girl gets suspicious of her own behaviour.
