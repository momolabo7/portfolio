Mallory is a simple game prototype I made in Unity. It is an endless vertical jumping platformer, where players try to climb as high as they can and leave their mark!

The motivation is to explore procedurally generated levels and also using Unity as an engine. 

I will probably create a more optimal desktop version some time in the future.
