This game has been making rounds in the VTuber space for awhile and I thought it looked really interesting. 
It brought my attention to the developer Mike Klubnika who has been making this kind of atmospheric games for awhile.

There's honestly not much to comment about the game other than how well done it is.
The atmosphere is perfect.
The gameplay, while short, feels complete with lots of potential for the developer to container expanding into areas like multiplayer, daily leaderboards, etc. 

The only small issue I find it that I'm not sure if the game is easily solved mathematically. 
If it is, then climbing for some kind of a high score might not be that interesting to do.

I do see the developer working on a multiplayer update though. Hopefully it will be fun!
