Momoko Mopiko was born Momoko Moko in Gridania to a working family of two Dunesfolk Lalafells. She grew up a distracted and curious, often attracting the attention of others while her parents are out at work. It wasn't long before Momoko attracted the attention of the Conjurers, who took her in immediately when they discovered her affinity with the elements.

Momoko became a skilful conjurer, but had several disagreements with the Twin Adders Grand Company  governing Gridania and the Conjurer's Guild including the White Mages. One particular incident caused Momoko to leave Gridania to Ul'dah to live with her grandmother.

Upset by everything that happened, Momoko decided to change her last name to Mopiko in an attempt to start anew. She was quickly picked up by the Thaumaturge guild. Similar to what happened in her birthplace, Momoko become a skilled Thaumaturge, but had disagreements with their guild leader and the Black Mages. Realising that the same thing might happen to her, Momoko left the guild and sought to seek her own way of living.

Several years passed. Momoko did several odd jobs and a fair bit of adventuring to hone her skills her own way.  Her unique skillset combining Conjurer and Thaumaturge skills caught the attention of the Crimson Duelists, who were recruiting at that time. Momoko eagerly joined, excited at the promise of adventure and curious about the unique "Red Magic" (Momoko would joke that it should've been called Grey Magic but Red Mages want to look good).

With the support from the Crimson Duelist, Momoko ventured as far as her legs and curiosity could take her, contributing to the knowledge of Red Magic through her discoveries.

When X'ruth Tia rallied the Crimson Duelists against the Mad King Theodoric, Momoko did not return, going so far as to calling him foolish and selfish for endangering everyone and pleaded him to find alternative ways. Momoko returned many moons later, appalled to learn about the death of her friends under Lambard's hands. She supposedly left the Crimson Duelists shortly after. 

No one really knows what Momoko's doing these days. Sometimes she's around chatting with innkeepers, merchants and guildmasters, and other times, she would be away so long that people would think that she's dead. Either way, they would tell you that "she seems happy".
