*a troubled look.*

"it's not like i hate talking. if anything, i love to [yap](../yap). im just not good at small talk."

*you ask about how their stuff was made.*

"oh that's a lot to talk about. i have like a [notebook over there](../tech)"

*you ask about games.*

"oh! what [games](../gamedev) do you want to talk about?"
