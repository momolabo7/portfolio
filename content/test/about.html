Heya! Welcome to my little slice of the internet. I hope you like what I did to this website, I had fun coding and designing it!

Oh right, about myself. I'm Momo! If you can't already tell from the website's design, programming is my bread and butter. I am born, raised and happily married in hot tropical Singapore (which really isn't that hot since it's almost sheltered everywhere).

I graduated from DigiPen Institute of Technology Singapore in 2013 with a Bachelor in Computer Science in Game Design (what a mouthful). I worked in the games industry for 6 years and am currently teaching programming and software development project modules in my alma meter. Notably, I had some experience living and working in Japan as a games developer. Even though I had no professional experience as a game designer, I do have tons of opinions about game design in general, having worked with many game designers both as a developer and a teacher.

Outside of games, I do enjoy dabbling in making tools and a bit of making art and music. I can play the piano and love the occasional singing in karaoke! Generally speaking though, I enjoy putting things together, though I'm rather clumsy physically and tend to stick to writing software, but I'm trying!
