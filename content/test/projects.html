<span>My big overarching project is C/C++ engine written from scratch (and I do mean from scratch; no libraries) that is used to develop my games and applications.</span><br> 
<span>Here are some projects written in that engine:</span><br>
<span>- <a href="https://momolabo.itch.io/lit">LIT</a> is a puzzle game about adding light colors</span><br>
<span>- <a href="https://momolabo.itch.io/dots-and-circles">Dots and Circles</a> is a simple bullet hell game where you can switch what bullet you can collect and avoid.</span><br>
<br>
<span>I also do some web stuff for fun:</span><br>
<span>- <a href="https://momolabo7.github.io/fvf/">Font vs Font</a> helps you decide which font you prefer.</span><br>
<span>- This <a href="https://momolabo7.github.io/pathfinding-visualizer/">Pathfinding Visualizer</a> was written in ReactJS. I do need to rewrite this so that it's smaller.</span><br>
<span>- <a href="../mopiko">This</a> website is dedicated to my FFXIV character.</span><br>
