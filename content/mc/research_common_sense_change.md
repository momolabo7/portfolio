title: "Research: Common Sense Change"
---

In mind control media, I have seen lots of this concept where the subject's idea of what's common sense is warped. It is also known as "常識変更" in japanese. 

In writing, it is an easy concept to abuse to allow almost any of the author's fantasies, like "having sex in public is normal" or "the main character is always right". Because people generally dismiss common sense as 'common sense', it is easy to write it such that the subject does not suspect anything because it is...well "common sense".

It's a little to easy for my taste. In writing, I feel that some constraint is needed. Sure, you can make it a 'power' that can be used once in awhile, but that's not really putting a constraint on the concept itself. 

What I'm kind of proposing for now is that when a subject's common sense changes, the common sense need to be questioned and the subject should be able to confidently think that it is okay through their own logic. The trick and difficulty is not to change how the real world works; everything that needs to change must come from within and align with the character's personality and memories. 

In other words, the less you change about the character, the better and hotter. What's even better is that through this thought process, maybe you can come up with a better common sense to change!

For example, let's say you want a subject to take off their bottoms and underwear before using the bathroom. A reason that makes sense for the subject might be that they think that the floor of a toilet is dirty and pooling their bottoms onto the ground or holding their bottoms is filthy. With this logic, the subject would probably want to hang it somewhere clean. As for letting others see their naked bottoms, the subject may agree and decide that a trusted friend (because it's better than a stranger) follow them to the toilet and strip there and then. Once in the toilet, they are okay with it since it's the same gender in there. It's even better if you can tie the character's personality into it! For example, a very logic driven character might choose to ignore social norms and trust her own logic. 

Basically, the more ass (haha) you cover, the hotter it becomes!

Anyway here is a list of scenarios of common sense change:

- Girl believes that undressing panties and bottoms before using the bathroom is normal.
  - hook: bathroom floor is dirty and holding own pants is dirty
- Girl believes that looking at face is disrespectful in conversation and should look at body, breasts, etc. Basically the reverse of "eyes up here!".
  - hook: looking at face is intrusive and embarassing, but it's rude to look away while talking so looking at the body is fine. 
- Girl believes that guys catcalling and making remarks about their body crudely is a great compliment.
  - hook: todo
