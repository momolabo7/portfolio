title: "A small shortcoming of return-by-value"

Recently, while coding on my personal C/C++ game engine project, I ran into a surprising shortcoming of functions that returns an object by value. This was when I was still trying to keep things consistant in my project and went for a functional-programming style.

<!--more-->

Consider that there are generally two simple ways to modify an object in C/C++ through plain functions.

Returning by value:
```cpp
struct v2f {
    float x, y; 
};

v2f CreateV2f(float x, float y) {
    return v2f { x, y };
}

// Usage
v2f Vec = CreateV2f(1.f, 2.f);
```

Modifying by pointer:
```cpp
struct v2f {
    float x, y; 
};

void InitV2f(v2f* Vec, float x, float y) {
    Vec->x = x;
    Vec->y = y;
}

// Usage
v2f Vec = {};
InitV2f(&Vec, 1.f, 2.f);
```

We can spend hours arguing about which one is better, but optimization and code readability aside, we can all agree that both functions generally does the same thing, at a relatively good speed.

So I have been using both styles interchangably for awhile now. Some scenarios, I feel like the first method is better while other times, the second feels better. Generally, it felt like both methods are interchangable. I ended up just going for the return-by-value style because copy elision is a thing. I did not profile the performance differences between the two styles so call it 'premature optimization' if you will, but I just wanted some consistency in my code. 

However I found a _slightly_ unexpected shortcoming of the return-by-value method. Consider the scenario:

```cpp
// Simple lightweight 'string' object.
struct String {
    char* data;
    int cap;
    int count;
};
String CreateString(char* buffer, int cap) {
    String ret = {};
    ret.data = buffer;
    ret.cap = cap;
};

struct StringWithBuffer {
    u8 buffer[256];
    String str; 
};

StringWithBuffer CreateStringWithBuffer() {
    StringWithBuffer ret = {};
    ret.str = CreateString(ret.buffer, 256);

    return ret; 
}

// Usage
StringWithBuffer foo = CreateStringWithBuffer();
// foo.str.data will not point to foo.str.buffer!
```

After calling `CreateStringWithBuffer()`, `foo.str.data` member will be pointing at an invalid address and not `foo.buffer`! This is obvious when you work out what happened step by step. Within `CreateStringWithBuffer()`, `ret.str.data` would end up correctly pointing to `ret.buffer`. However, `ret` is actually a temporary object, so `ret.buffer` will naturally become invalid after the function is done. It's obvious after pointing it out, but I think it's fair to say that most of us thought that there would not be a problem with `CreateStringWithBuffer()`, because it looks so straightforward and simple. 

Thinking about it, C++ constructors will never have this issue because you are modifying `this` and returns a reference to itself. (However, I have a lot of things against C++ constructors, which I might go into another article when I can).   

Thankfully, the pointer version will not have the issue:

```cpp
// Simple lightweight 'string' object.
struct String {
    char* data;
    int cap;
    int count;
};
String CreateString(char* buffer, int cap) {
    String ret = {};
    ret.data = buffer;
    ret.cap = cap;
};

struct StringWithBuffer {
    u8 buffer[256];
    String str; 
};

void CreateStringWithBuffer(StringWithBuffer* Foo) {
    Foo->Str = CreateString(Foo->Buffer, 256);
}

// Usage
StringWithBuffer foo = {};
CreateStringWithBuffer(&foo);
// foo.str.data correctly points to foo.str.buffer!
```

In the end, I really shouldn't have cared that much.
