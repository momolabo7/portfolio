Before I go on, I would like to say that it&rsquo;s a pretty decent game.
I can see why there are people who loved and hate it.
Here I&rsquo;m just going to pen down thoughts I find about the game.</p><p>Sorry about the word vomit in advance, and of course, spoilers from here on!</p><p>The UI design of the game starts of minimalistic and that kind of fell off as the game progresses.
I fully empathize that it is very difficult to have a truly &lsquo;minimalistic&rsquo; UI but still, I think they can do a bit better.</p><p>I really loved the setting and the design of the robots in the game.
The cats are really cute and the animations were done well.
The designers clearly put a lot of care into the cats.</p><p>I&rsquo;m a bit disappoint over some of the details though.
For example, I was able to trip a person once, but never again.
In this way, it felt like every event I experienced in the game felt too scripted and static.</p><p>Gameplay was generally okay.</p><p>It was actually surprisingly difficult to predict what kind of &rsquo;level&rsquo; the game is going to throw at me next, which is good because I did not lose interest throughout the game.
This is probably attributed to the vastly different genre that each level represents (i.e. runners, &lsquo;parkouring&rsquo;, exploration, stealth&mldr;beat &rsquo;em up?).</p><p>The basic parkour gameplay felt a LOT like Assassin&rsquo;s Creed, so I didn&rsquo;t feel any &lsquo;magic&rsquo; in that regard.
If anything it felt like a less dynamic version of Assassin&rsquo;s Creed&rsquo;s implementation.
This was when I realized that AC is made in 2007; almost 15 years ago?
We have really come a long way.
But then again, people love cats so&mldr;that makes it better I guess?</p><p>Okay now for things I couldn&rsquo;t stand.</p><p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just me but I wasn&rsquo;t sure why I needed to help the robots.
All I was interested in was returning to the three cats that abandoned me, which I didn&rsquo;t and that made me felt that there is no closure to the game (yes yes, there&rsquo;s a closure to the setting, but meow! I have to get back at my bros!)</p><p>I also tilted at every uneven steps the game had.
They clearly have the collision of a slope, so that kind of broke immersion for me in an otherwise beautiful world.</p><p>Finally, I cannot understand why are there conveniently placed &lsquo;platforms&rsquo; on every two steps of a ladder. I understand that it helps the player proceed but c&rsquo;mon, it felt so lazy.</p><p>I think that&rsquo;s all I have to say about Stray. Good game. Good music. Good experience. Definitely worth the buy in my opinion. The developers wanted to make an adventure game with a cat main character and they did it.</p><p>I look forward to their next game.</p><p>I give this game a meow out of 10.</p></div></div></div><footer>Powered By Hugo | v2.0 | © 2022 Gerald Wong</footer></body></html>
