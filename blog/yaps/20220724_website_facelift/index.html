A year later, however, I just couldn't look at it straight in the eye anymore.
Perhaps it's because I developed a stronger opinion on what I want my site to be.
Here I'll share some of my thoughts.</p><p>The color scheme that recently grew onto me was something similar to gruvbox, but darker.
I have been using it for my text editors and now I'm trying it out on this website.
I do think that it's generally okay (maybe it could be brighter) but LATEX rendering for some of my old blog posts looks ugly.
I will probably need to fix that one day.</p><p>Another thing I really grew into recently was reading and writing things in monospaced font.
Maybe it's because I'm a programmer, but I think it's annoying to write posts with both LATEX <strong>and</strong> code.
I find the context switch between different fonts rather jarring so I thought it's better to stick to as little fonts as possible to maintain consistency, as opposed to finding the right font for the right purpose.</p><p>I think that's the thing; consistency.
I no longer use lists of images, wrangling with weird image overlays in CSS and trying to find the best screenshot for each item in the list.
Now I just stick to blog-post-like text pages as much as possible.
The nicest side-effect about consistency is that the code for this website was drastically reduced (because I'm a programmer :))</p><p>Now, moving forward.</p><p>I have been writing blog posts for so many years now, most of it lost somewhere in Blogspot, Wordpress or LiveJournal.
I remember looking back at some of these posts and found them cringe because I was really a naive person back then.
Nowadays, I tend to stick to what I want to say in public.
This is evidenced by the things I post on Twitter in recent years.
However, Twitter is limited and there are times when you just want to write a post that is archived at your space instead of being flooded by social media feeds.
Moreover, I own these posts (like literally, they are Markdown Files on my computer) so that's a nice thing to have.</p><p>I say all this because the blog section of this website is kind of dead.
Back then, I kind of decided that the safest thing to post about is about technology, and it also acts as a backup of programming or math derivations I made during my work.
Unforuntely, making such posts requires a lot of effort and I'm getting busier and busier as I flood myself with more projects and more work.
And there <strong>are</strong> things occassionally want to blog about, like reminsicing about my time in some projects or something cool that I saw somewhere that I want to share my hopefully good opinion on.
You know, just thoughts that I would like to not only pen down, but to also share to whoever is bothered to read them</p><p>So I guess this is yet another reboot of my blog.</p><p>Hopefully it works out this time.</p><p>If it doesn't, there's <strong>always</strong> next time, right?</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
