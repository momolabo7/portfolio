There&rsquo;s a lot of the game that I liked and didn&rsquo;t like but I figured that I figured that I&rsquo;ll put my opinions on hold until its release.</p><p>Now that it&rsquo;s released, I played it till the end and apparently my opinions about it didn&rsquo;t change much.</p><p>The game has a very consistent and strong theme.
It felt like the developers had a clear themetic and aesthetic vision of the game from the very start and did not waver in achieving that vision.
At least, there isn&rsquo;t a time where I felt the game is confused.</p><p>The gameplay loop is striaghtforward.
You make potions, sell potions, buy ingredients, research new potions, make potions and repeat.</p><p>The main mechanic, I presume, is the exploration of the alchemy map.
Different ingredients will dictate different paths you will take, and you will have to use a series of different ingredients to navigate through the map, avoiding obstacles, to find an &rsquo;effect'.</p><p>I thought that the alchemy exploration mechanic is novel and cool in concept.
My worry was that I wasn&rsquo;t sure how it would scale in what I would consider a fun way.
After all, you are exploring the same map over and over again.
In my head, for exploration-based mechanics like this, I could only think of 3 ways to keep things refresh each run:</p><ol><li>Add some level of procedural level generation.</li><li>Minimize the amount of times the players have to traverse the same map (ala quick travel systems, etc).</li><li>Add objectives that make players tackle the same map in different ways (ala Mario 64?)</li><li>Just don&rsquo;t let players play the same map (although this is probably not possible even what they want to accomplish).</li></ol><p>These were what I was thinking when Potion Craft was in Early Access and a small part of me hoped that</p><p>I guess in a way, Potion Craft did point #2 and #3.
They did #2 by allowing me to &lsquo;save&rsquo; recipes, which is basically allowing me to add checkpoints in the map so that I don&rsquo;t have to traverse the same path again.
#3 is accomplished simply by having concrete objectives.</p><p>However, it still felt a little repeatitive and tedious.
I think the issue I have is that the objectives are too similar; they only differ by tediousness.
No matter what you do in the game, you are simply asked to traverse to different points in the map.</p><p>I wondered if the developers could solve this.
A part of me felt that the mechanics drove them to this wall and could not be solved.
A small part of me hoped that they would be able to solve it on release.</p><p>Release came and I picked it up again, powering through towards the last chapters.
There were many good changes but in the end, the repetitiveness of the main mechanic remains.
I can really tell they tried with the new changes.
For example, they tried to contrain what ingredients I can use by saying that some consumers have allergies (I didn&rsquo;t care because I was still making money).
I am honestly not sure if contraining is a good idea to be honest, and the developers probably thought the same by making it a soft constrain; as players you can choose to adhere to it or not.</p><p>Anyway, the game is pretty good and worth a buy.
Personally it feels a 8/10 game, but I can see how others might like it better than I do.</p><p>One side thing I wonder though.
In the game, you can choose to serve evil and good customers.
Evil customers are straightforwardly evil: blowing stuff up, murder, etc.
Good customers can be straightforwardly good, but they are more horny; I wonder if there is any message that the developers are trying to imply&mldr;</p></div></div></div><footer>Powered By Hugo | v2.0 | © 2024 Momoko Mopiko</footer></body></html>
