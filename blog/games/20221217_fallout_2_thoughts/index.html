Just like Fallout 1, it's so refreshing to play it in 2022.</p><p>The formula they used for storytelling seemed to be similar Fallout 1. You start off as a nobody, go out there to explore the wasteland, found a big threat, solve the big threat and return as a nobody.</p><p>One thing I noticed that's different from Fallout 1 is how the lots of quests seem to span across different towns. This results in lots of travelling, which might explain why the developers provided a car in the game.</p><p>I really liked the characters that are clearly given time to flesh out in the game like Sulik, Vic, Myron, Marcus, etc. I wish they did more for characters like Lenny the ghoul.</p><p>Another thing I really liked was the dynamics of politics. There are glimpses of scientology with the Hubologists, police state with NCR and facism with the Enclave. It's really cool to see how these ideals clash and how they affect the people around them.</p><p>An issue I had with the game is that the ending felt a little forced and rushed. The last few quests felt as if the writers ran out of budget or ideas about how to ease the player towards the last area. Everybody that you need help from suddenly seem to know your full mission and its context without you mentioning anything.</p><p>Overall, it was a really fun ride. I give it a dogmeat out of 10.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
