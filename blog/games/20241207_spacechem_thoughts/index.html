The game is one of the first games made by Zach-tonic games, which went on later to define the Zachlike-genre; basically a game of puzzle solving using systems. Basically, if you like any amount of puzzle solving, automation and engineering, Zachlike games are for you.</p><p>I graduated at 2013. It is now 2024 when I completed the game. It took so long to complete the game that the company ceased to exist because "it has already made all the games they wanted to make". Yes. I took so long to complete it that they made so many games until they ran out of games to make.</p><p>Every puzzle is constant unintuitive grind and banging my head against the wall. Perhaps a reason why I didn't play it much was because my day job already involves a good amount of problem solving for myself and others. Recently, I have finished the game I want to make, an engine I want to make, solved some issues with my work and was a little bored of programming, to the point where I finally found some bandwidth to complete Spacechem.</p><p>The satisfaction you get from completing a puzzle felt really good though.</p><p>I would highly recommend it. 8/10! But it's really not for everyone.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
