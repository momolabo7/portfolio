&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Defect
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Remember that Defect is really good at burst and ramp.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;details>
 &lt;summary>Defect | A03 | 1J77DEYNVUZMN | Failed&lt;/summary>
 &lt;ul>
&lt;li>Act 1.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Boss: Turtle&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Neow Bonus: Lose all god, get rare card: Took Thunder Strike over Seek and Barrier.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Found early Melter and Streamline. I think...Melter should be good for turtle...?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Elite: Laguvivi. Thunder Strike seem so bad atm. Streamline and Melter+ are doing work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Found Pen Nib.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Found Recursion. I think there's synergy with Thunder Strike??&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sentries: Got really slow. Thunder Strike still not pulling weight...&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Took Consume. Not really sure if it's a good idea.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Beat Turtle. Not a bad fight. Took Echo Form. Took Runic Dome (kinda need the energy)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Act 2.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Died to Knight and Mage. Consume is probably a bad card. Thunder Strike too. Not enough block.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/details>

It's very clearly inspired by it, even though the puzzle mechanics are a little different. I'll say this first; it's a good game that's well worth the money. It's clearly a product built with lots of care and love from the developer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Review: The Roottrees are Dead</title><link>/blog/games/20250130_the_roottrees_are_dead_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/blog/games/20250130_the_roottrees_are_dead_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>This game is really is made for doomscrollers and tea sippers lol.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Review: Rise of the Golden Idol</title><link>/blog/games/20250118_rise_of_the_golden_idol_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/blog/games/20250118_rise_of_the_golden_idol_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was looking back at my &amp;quot;Case Of The Golden Idol&amp;quot; review and I was astounded that it was written in 2023!
Anyway, the developers apparently decided to release a new game (not a DLC!) due to popular demand and I immediately bought it to give it a shot.
Spoilers ahead!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BG3 Plans: Faylar</title><link>/blog/games/20250102_bg3_plan_faylar/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2025 13:40:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/blog/games/20250102_bg3_plan_faylar/</guid><description>&lt;p>These are plans for the character Faylar.

Let's get the easy stuff out of the way first. The game has amazing music, UI, art style and theme.
The team has always been excellent in these aspects and are often brought up in case studies in my classes.
With that out of the way, here are my thoughts on my playthrough.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Postmorterm: LIT</title><link>/blog/games/20230810_primix_dev_postmorterm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 23:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/blog/games/20230810_primix_dev_postmorterm/</guid><description>&lt;p>Alright, the game is &lt;a href="https://momolabo.itch.io/lit">out on itch.io&lt;/a> for free.

It was also recommended by Lucas Pope, developer of &lt;em>Return To Obra Dinn&lt;/em>.
While waiting for my VISA in Singapore, I managed to allocate some time to play it on stream.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Review: Return To Obra Dinn</title><link>/blog/games/20230402_return_to_obra_dinn_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2023 12:31:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/blog/games/20230402_return_to_obra_dinn_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had this game for awhile now in my Steam library, but like all games on it, I never took managed to allocate time for it until a friend speaks about it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Review: Cyberpunk 2077</title><link>/blog/games/20230114_cyberpunk_2077_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/blog/games/20230114_cyberpunk_2077_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I finally took the time to complete Cyberpunk 2077 today.
It's been a while since I played an open world western RPG.
I believe the last one I played was Skyrim when it first released in 2011.
...man, that was really a long time ago.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Review: Fallout 2</title><link>/blog/games/20221217_fallout_2_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2022 14:44:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/blog/games/20221217_fallout_2_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I played Fallout 2 in 2022 and here are my thoughts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like Fallout 1, I have also played Fallout 2 as a kid. Just like Fallout 1, it's so refreshing to play it in 2022.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Review: Fallout 1</title><link>/blog/games/20221117_fallout_1_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 14:44:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/blog/games/20221117_fallout_1_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I played Fallout 1 in 2022 and here are my thoughts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, let me give a disclaimer and say that I have played Fallout 1 as a kid when the game is still in a CD.
I remember positive emotions playing the game but all I remembered as an adult before playing it again was that you are the Vault Dweller from Vault 13 and you need to find a water chip within some kind of a time limit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Review: Stray</title><link>/blog/games/20220731_stray_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 13:40:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/blog/games/20220731_stray_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just played this game called 'Stray' over the week just to check out what all the hype was about.
Before I go on, I would like to say that it's a pretty decent game.
I can see why there are people who loved and hate it.
Here I'm just going to pen down thoughts I find about the game.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sorry about the word vomit in advance, and of course, spoilers from here on!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Postmorterm: Dots and Circles</title><link>/blog/games/20211201_dots_and_circles_dev_postmorterm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 23:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/blog/games/20211201_dots_and_circles_dev_postmorterm/</guid><description>&lt;p>Alright, the game is &lt;a href="https://momohoudai.itch.io/dots-and-circles">out on itch.io&lt;/a> for free!
