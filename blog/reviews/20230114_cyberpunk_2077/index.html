It's been a while since I played an open world western RPG.
I believe the last one I played was Skyrim when it first released in 2011.
...man, that was really a long time ago.</p><p>The reason I didn't play Cyberpunk on release was mostly because of all the bugs I heard that were in there on release. I thought that maybe I should wait a year before trying it out. There were still some bugs, but thankfully I did not encounter anything game breaking.</p><p>Leveling up and figuring out what to build was fun. It seems that there isn't really a way to 'screw up' your build, so players can really express their builds based on what they think is fun on the skill trees. I remember that when I played Oblivion or Skyrim, the viable builds are quite biased towards a certain direction, so it's great to see so many different cool builds posted online for Cyberpunk, you increases replayability.</p><p>The story is pretty good overall. I really liked that the general idea that they are trying to send is how screwed up Night City is as a concept and how living there consumes people. The side quests are well written, the twists are alright, and what I call the 'plot device to push you to the main quest urgently' was interesting. It's at least better than 'oh hero, you must find XXX from YYY'.</p><p>Speaking of Night City, walking around was fine, but I felt that the repeatable quests in the game could be less...repeatitive. There really is only one kind of repeatable quest, which is just to take down enemies. Well, that's actually 99% of the quests that you do actually. Maybe I'm expecting too much from sandbox games.</p><p>Overall a really good game. I would definitely replay it in the future, especially if they have a DLC. I hope the developers had a good rest from the terrible launch they had a year ago.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
