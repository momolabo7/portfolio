That game, and using Dante and Vergil in Marvel vs Capcom 3, defined what a Devil May Cry series of games mean.</p><p>That being said, while I think it's a good game, I felt that its formula is dated. I could never understand why an action heavy game like this tend to lean to be a platformer at times. I always believed an action game should just be about action, and the puzzles should stick to that genre in some way.</p><p>No, I just want to beat stuff up and do my combos! I don't want to be punished to do some random ass platforming to find something that can increase my maximum HP! Sure, I don't need those things to clear the game but it still feels bad. Why not challenge me to hit a certain score on on an interesting set of enemies instead?</p><p>Another thing that irks me is that the formula on how the levels progressed didn't change either. It's just cutscene > action > cutscene > action. It's the same across all DMCs and I felt like they should at least be a little more adventerous and change it up. It gets boring once players figure out the pattern.</p><p>And the puzzles. God. The puzzles don't even make sense. It does not even engage me mentally so, why bother even having them? Why pretend that it's a different obstacle when, at the end of the day, I'm just looking for the next area with stuff to kill?</p><p>Honestly, if the next DMC is like this, I might not have the motivation to try it out.</p><p>On to characters.</p><p>Dante is the same as the DMC4 Dante. He's still enjoyable to play with the changing of styles and, really, his gameplay carried my enjoyment of the game.</p><p>V was actually quite fun to play. I liked his summoner-like style of combat where you have to evade attacks (V cannot damage enemies on his own) while controlling his pets AND the fact that you have to get V close to finish any enemies off was REALLY cool.</p><p>Playing Nero unfortunately felt awkward. I probably did not explore him enough because...I just want to hit stuff. They made it so that he can have different expandable arms which does different things. I didn't really like the idea of spending money on expandable equipment in action games so off the bat, it's kind of a turn off.</p><p>The abilities of Nero's arms can be cool, but sometimes it felt like they are just there for fun. It does feel cheap in the sense that the designers can do whatever they want without thinking if it makes sense for the game...which is fine but I'm not really sure if that add Nero himself any identity.</p><p>The only thing that Nero has is that he can pull himself towards enemies or pull enemies towards him and...that's about it really. Otherwise, he seems like a less interesting Dante. The revving of his sword seems cool but it's so difficult to actually use that it felt like a niche. Maybe the developers did think that he's not interesting enough and that's why he got the disposable arm thing but...it just feels like they are grasping for straws.</p><p>Anyway I think I have yapped enough about Dante.</p><p>imma give this game a 6/10. Without Dante or Vergil, it's probably a 4/10.</p><p>The "Fuck you" Nero did at the end was REALLY funny though.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
