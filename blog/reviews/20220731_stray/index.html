Before I go on, I would like to say that it's a pretty decent game.
I can see why there are people who loved and hate it.
Here I'm just going to pen down thoughts I find about the game.</p><p>Sorry about the word vomit in advance, and of course, spoilers from here on!</p><p>The UI design of the game starts of minimalistic and that kind of fell off as the game progresses.
I fully empathize that it is very difficult to have a truly 'minimalistic' UI but still, I think they can do a bit better.</p><p>I really loved the setting and the design of the robots in the game.
The cats are really cute and the animations were done well.
The designers clearly put a lot of care into the cats.</p><p>I'm a bit disappoint over some of the details though.
For example, I was able to trip a person once, but never again.
In this way, it felt like every event I experienced in the game felt too scripted and static.</p><p>Gameplay was generally okay.</p><p>It was actually surprisingly difficult to predict what kind of 'level' the game is going to throw at me next, which is good because I did not lose interest throughout the game.
This is probably attributed to the vastly different genre that each level represents (i.e. runners, 'parkouring', exploration, stealth...beat 'em up?).</p><p>The basic parkour gameplay felt a LOT like Assassin's Creed, so I didn't feel any 'magic' in that regard.
If anything it felt like a less dynamic version of Assassin's Creed's implementation.
This was when I realized that AC is made in 2007; almost 15 years ago?
We have really come a long way.
But then again, people love cats so...that makes it better I guess?</p><p>Okay now for things I couldn't stand.</p><p>Maybe it's just me but I wasn't sure why I needed to help the robots.
All I was interested in was returning to the three cats that abandoned me, which I didn't and that made me felt that there is no closure to the game (yes yes, there's a closure to the setting, but meow! I have to get back at my bros!)</p><p>I also tilted at every uneven steps the game had.
They clearly have the collision of a slope, so that kind of broke immersion for me in an otherwise beautiful world.</p><p>Finally, I cannot understand why are there conveniently placed 'platforms' on every two steps of a ladder. I understand that it helps the player proceed but c'mon, it felt so lazy.</p><p>I think that's all I have to say about Stray. Good game. Good music. Good experience. Definitely worth the buy in my opinion. The developers wanted to make an adventure game with a cat main character and they did it.</p><p>I look forward to their next game.</p><p>I give this game a meow out of 10.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
