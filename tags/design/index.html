Let&rsquo;s get the easy stuff out of the way first. The game has amazing music, UI, art style and theme.
The team has always been excellent in these aspects and are often brought up in case studies in my classes.
With that out of the way, here are my thoughts on my playthrough.</p></div><hr></article><article><header><h1><a href=/gamedev/20230810_primix_dev_postmorterm/>Lit Dev Postmorterm</a></h1><div><time datetime=2023-08-29T23:00:00+08:00>Aug 29, 2023</time></div></header><div><p>Alright, the game is <a href=https://momolabo.itch.io/lit>out on itch.io</a> for free.

It was also recommended by Lucas Pope, developer of <em>Return To Obra Dinn</em>.

It&rsquo;s been a while since I played an open world western RPG.
I believe the last one I played was Skyrim when it first released in 2011.

I remember positive emotions playing the game but all I remembered as an adult before playing it again was that you are the Vault Dweller from Vault 13 and you need to find a water chip within some kind of a time limit.</p></div><hr></article></div></div></body></html>
