I think it slipped my mind because it's kind of difficult to describe a game like this to me. Perhaps it is because of the aesthetic direction the game took.</p></div><hr></article><article><header><h1><a href=/blog/games/20240615_thoughts_on_ghost_trick/>Review: Ghost Trick</a></h1><div><time datetime=2024-06-15T12:00:00+08:00>Jun 15, 2024</time></div></header><div><p>After many recommendations, I finally picked up and completed Ghost Trick.

Let's get the easy stuff out of the way first. The game has amazing music, UI, art style and theme.
The team has always been excellent in these aspects and are often brought up in case studies in my classes.
With that out of the way, here are my thoughts on my playthrough.</p></div><hr></article><article><header><h1><a href=/blog/games/20230810_primix_dev_postmorterm/>Postmorterm: LIT</a></h1><div><time datetime=2023-08-29T23:00:00+08:00>Aug 29, 2023</time></div></header><div><p>Alright, the game is <a href=https://momolabo.itch.io/lit>out on itch.io</a> for free.
This is the 2nd game I have made using a rewrite of the engine I used in <a href=https://momolabo.itch.io/dots_and_circles>dots and circles</a>.</p></div><hr></article><article><header><h1><a href=/blog/games/20230402_return_to_obra_dinn_thoughts/>Review: Return To Obra Dinn</a></h1><div><time datetime=2023-04-02T12:31:00+08:00>Apr 2, 2023</time></div></header><div><p>I had this game for awhile now in my Steam library, but like all games on it, I never took managed to allocate time for it until a friend speaks about it.</p></div><hr></article><article><header><h1><a href=/blog/games/20230114_cyberpunk_2077_thoughts/>Review: Cyberpunk 2077</a></h1><div><time datetime=2023-01-14T12:00:00+08:00>Jan 14, 2023</time></div></header><div><p>I finally took the time to complete Cyberpunk 2077 today.
It's been a while since I played an open world western RPG.
I believe the last one I played was Skyrim when it first released in 2011.

I remember positive emotions playing the game but all I remembered as an adult before playing it again was that you are the Vault Dweller from Vault 13 and you need to find a water chip within some kind of a time limit.</p></div><hr></article></div></div></body></html>
