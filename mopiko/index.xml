She grew up a distracted and curious, often attracting the attention of others while her parents are out at work. It wasn't long before Momoko attracted the attention of the Conjurers, who took her in immediately when they discovered her affinity with the elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Momoko became a skilful conjurer, but had several disagreements with the Twin Adders Grand Company governing Gridania and the Conjurer's Guild including the White Mages. One particular incident caused Momoko to leave Gridania to Ul'dah to live with her grandmother.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
