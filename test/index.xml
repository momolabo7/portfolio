Heya! Welcome to my little slice of the internet. I hope you like what I did to this website, I had fun coding and designing it!
&lt;/p>
&lt;br>

&lt;p>
Oh right, about myself. I'm Momo! If you can't already tell from the website's design, programming is my bread and butter. I am born, raised and happily married in hot tropical Singapore (which really isn't that hot since it's almost sheltered everywhere).
&lt;/p>

&lt;br>
&lt;p>
I graduated from DigiPen Institute of Technology Singapore in 2013 with a Bachelor in Computer Science in Game Design (what a mouthful). I worked in the games industry for 6 years and am currently teaching programming and software development project modules in my alma meter. Notably, I had some experience living and working in Japan as a games developer. Even though I had no professional experience as a game designer, I do have tons of opinions about game design in general, having worked with many game designers both as a developer and a teacher.

&lt;p>Here are some projects written in that engine:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>- &lt;a href="https://momolabo.itch.io/lit">LIT&lt;/a> is a puzzle game about adding light colors&lt;/p>
&lt;p>- &lt;a href="https://momolabo.itch.io/dots-and-circles">Dots and Circles&lt;/a> is a simple bullet hell game where you can switch what bullet you can collect and avoid.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I also do some web stuff for fun:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>/test/welcome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/test/welcome/</guid><description>&lt;p class="banner">

&lt;p>&amp;quot;those? just some scribbles you can read, i don't mind.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>you look at the books curiously&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;quot;they are mostly about &lt;a href="./gamedev">games&lt;/a>, some &lt;a href="./tech">tech&lt;/a> stuff and the occassional &lt;a href="./yap">rant&lt;/a>&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>a laugh&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
