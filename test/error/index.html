Heya! Welcome to my little slice of the internet. I hope you like what I did to this website, I had fun coding and designing it!\r
</p>\r
<br>\r
\r
<p>\r
Oh right, about myself. I'm Momo! If you can't already tell from the website's design, programming is my bread and butter. I am born, raised and happily married in hot tropical Singapore (which really isn't that hot since it's almost sheltered everywhere).\r
</p>\r
\r
<br>\r
<p>\r
I graduated from DigiPen Institute of Technology Singapore in 2013 with a Bachelor in Computer Science in Game Design (what a mouthful). I worked in the games industry for 6 years and am currently teaching programming and software development project modules in my alma meter. Notably, I had some experience living and working in Japan as a games developer. Even though I had no professional experience as a game designer, I do have tons of opinions about game design in general, having worked with many game designers both as a developer and a teacher. \r
</p>\r
<br>\r
\r
<p>\r
Outside of games, I do enjoy dabbling in making tools and a bit of making art and music. I can play the piano and love the occasional singing in karaoke! Generally speaking though, I enjoy putting things together, though I'm rather clumsy physically and tend to stick to writing software, but I'm trying!\r

<p>Welcome to my website!</p>\r
<p>Let me know if you need 'help' ;)</p>\r
`,cmd_projects=`<p>My big overarching project is C/C++ engine written from scratch (and I do mean from scratch; no libraries) that is used to develop my games and applications.</p> \r
<p>Here are some projects written in that engine:</p>\r
<p>- <a href="https://momolabo.itch.io/lit">LIT</a> is a puzzle game about adding light colors</p>\r
<p>- <a href="https://momolabo.itch.io/dots-and-circles">Dots and Circles</a> is a simple bullet hell game where you can switch what bullet you can collect and avoid.</p>\r
\r
<p>I also do some web stuff for fun:</p>\r
<p>- <a href="https://momolabo7.github.io/fvf/">Font vs Font</a> helps you decide which font you prefer.</p>\r
<p>- This <a href="https://momolabo7.github.io/pathfinding-visualizer/">Pathfinding Visualizer</a> was written in ReactJS. I do need to rewrite this so that it's smaller.</p>\r
