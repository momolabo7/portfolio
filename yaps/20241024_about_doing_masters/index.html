Working in education, it could advance my career, it could give me a wider view of things and people could start treating me differently.</p><p>On advancing my career, the place I&rsquo;m working at is kind of an escalator; pay increases with time spent, not title promotion. Getting a Master or PHD might increase my pay but not by a large amount. Masters might give me more opportunities like taking on research projects or more jobs I can take on but I am not interested in any of that. Selfishly, I just want more time to myself, my family and friends. Yes, the research projects pitched to me in school were all very interesting and exciting from an average CS person&rsquo;s view, but I honestly don&rsquo;t feel strongly enough to partake in any of that. As just more jobs I can take on, bro, I&rsquo;m already happy at where I am and so busy that I don&rsquo;t want to do anything else.</p><p>Sure, maybe it will allow me to work in other, more established universities, maybe even overseas. What if I quit or get laid off? This is basically the fool-proofing my career argument. The truth is, I think I&rsquo;m already financially well off. Even if I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m fairly confident in finding similarly paying jobs that I might be interested in given my connections. And, I don&rsquo;t even know if I want to bother working in other universities, considering how much I know how mainstream academia works. God that&rsquo;s so much rubbish that goes on in mainstream academia that I just&mldr;don&rsquo;t, lol. I should probably make a post about that one day. Obviously, I&rsquo;m not saying that all mainstream academia is bad, but just thinking about working in that environment makes me rather be a cashier at my grocery store. On top of that, I don&rsquo;t even know if I actually want to stay in mainstream teaching if I left my school. The reasons why I love my job is slowly reducing as more mainstream academia and teaching directives seep into my work (which also warrants another rant post lol)</p><p>Next is the better perspective thing. If I wanted better perspective, honestly I would just switch jobs. I already know so much about CS through my peers. While things might be different in different CS sectors, let&rsquo;s be real: how different can it be? If I want different experiences, I&rsquo;ll go be a politician or a content creator or a bus driver or a garbage collector. For studying, I would rather pick up some non-CS degree like psychology or food sciences or even an MBA. And I don&rsquo;t even really WANT to do those things. By myself, I&rsquo;m already swamped with personal things I want to do or even things I want to do with friends and family that I feel will give me a better perspective, make me a better person and more.</p><p>The last point is about people&rsquo;s perception of me. In other words, the initial respect I&rsquo;ll get when I meet someone. I instinctively shrugged that reasoning off but I decided to give it more thought. It is true: if you have a Masters or PHD, conversation around you does change. I agree that this will make networking in the academia CS circles easier but&mldr;I don&rsquo;t understand why I want to do that. People whom I want to think that I&rsquo;m a capable programmer already know that I am. I have also constantly proven that you don&rsquo;t need a Masters or PHD to be a better person or master at their craft. I have seen Master and PHD holders complain and bitch about their course and degrees, or realise that they don&rsquo;t want anything to do with their degrees anymore. Do I want to throw time and money for something I don&rsquo;t even need for the sake of some arbitrary person&rsquo;s surface level of respect? Do I really care about someone who judges people by their bag of certificates? I have always loathed those kind of people who genuinely look down people based on their GPAs, school education and worse: race and gender. I understand why they think like that but when they compare degrees and accomplishments like a dick size and orientation contest, it disgusts me. Yes, this includes people who look up to me because I wrote my own game engine in C. Yes, it&rsquo;s worth some respect I guess, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should look down on those who didn&rsquo;t do it like they are trash immediately.</p><p>Honestly, I was entertaining the thought of doing my Masters for the past couple of days, but the more I think about it, the less meaning I find in it, both objectively and emotionally. There are so many other things I&rsquo;d rather be doing man. Also, at this age, having a Masters in CS doesn&rsquo;t give as much respect as actually developing a product!</p></div></div></div></body></html>
