This time, I&rsquo;m going to stay for a couple of years to accompany my wife as she does her Masters.
I thought that it would be fun to list down some random things that I personally find interesting about Japan, since this place is kind of like my 3rd home at this point.</p></div><hr class=blog_list_divider></article><article id=blog-list-content><header><h1><a class=blog_title href=/yaps/20210422_going_from_md_to_adoc/>Going from Markdown to Asciidoc</a></h1><div class=blog_date><time datetime=2023-04-22T14:44:00+08:00>Apr 22, 2023</time></div></header><div class=blog_body><p>Here I&rsquo;ll pin down my thought process of changing my work&rsquo;s documentations from Markdown to Asciidoc.
I have been switching endlessly back and forth between them and it&rsquo;s getting really annoying because I just want to do my work at some point.
Hopefully after writing this, I will never look back until maybe 5 years later.</p></div><hr class=blog_list_divider></article><article id=blog-list-content><header><h1><a class=blog_title href=/yaps/20230210_chatgpt_thoughts/>I tried ChatGPT</a></h1><div class=blog_date><time datetime=2023-02-10T12:00:00+08:00>Feb 10, 2023</time></div></header><div class=blog_body><p>I have been spending an unhealthy amount of time for the past 3 weeks playing around with ChatGPT instead of doing my work.
Seeing it evolve (some might argue &lsquo;devolve&rsquo;) day by day with &lsquo;better&rsquo; filters was interesting.
It&rsquo;s quite amazing to see the different things it <em>was</em> capable of.</p></div><hr class=blog_list_divider></article><article id=blog-list-content><header><h1><a class=blog_title href=/yaps/20220724_website_facelift/>Website Facelift</a></h1><div class=blog_date><time datetime=2022-07-24T12:00:00+08:00>Jul 24, 2022</time></div></header><div class=blog_body><p>It&rsquo;s time for another facelift!</p><p>Seriously though, I remembered liking the previous site design.
A year later, however, I just couldn&rsquo;t look at it straight in the eye anymore.
Perhaps it&rsquo;s because I developed a stronger opinion on what I want my site to be.
Here I&rsquo;ll share some of my thoughts.</p></div><hr class=blog_list_divider></article></div></div></body></html>
