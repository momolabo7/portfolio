<span id=single_time><time datetime=2023-01-14T12:00:00+08:00>Jan 14, 2023</time></span><hr><p>I finally took the time to complete Cyberpunk 2077 today.
It&rsquo;s been a while since I played an open world western RPG.
I believe the last one I played was Skyrim when it first released in 2011.
&mldr;man, that was really a long time ago.</p><p>The reason I didn&rsquo;t play Cyberpunk on release was mostly because of all the bugs I heard that were in there on release. I thought that maybe I should wait a year before trying it out. There were still some bugs, but thankfully I did not encounter anything game breaking.</p><p>Leveling up and figuring out what to build was fun. It seems that there isn&rsquo;t really a way to &lsquo;screw up&rsquo; your build, so players can really express their builds based on what they think is fun on the skill trees. I remember that when I played Oblivion or Skyrim, the viable builds are quite biased towards a certain direction, so it&rsquo;s great to see so many different cool builds posted online for Cyberpunk, you increases replayability.</p><p>The story is pretty good overall. I really liked that the general idea that they are trying to send is how screwed up Night City is as a concept and how living there consumes people. The side quests are well written, the twists are alright, and what I call the &lsquo;plot device to push you to the main quest urgently&rsquo; was interesting. It&rsquo;s at least better than &lsquo;oh hero, you must find XXX from YYY&rsquo;.</p><p>Speaking of Night City, walking around was fine, but I felt that the repeatable quests in the game could be less&mldr;repeatitive. There really is only one kind of repeatable quest, which is just to take down enemies. Well, that&rsquo;s actually 99% of the quests that you do actually. Maybe I&rsquo;m expecting too much from sandbox games.</p><p>Overall a really good game. I would definitely replay it in the future, especially if they have a DLC. I hope the developers had a good rest from the terrible launch they had a year ago.</p></div></div></body></html>
