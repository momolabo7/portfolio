<span id=single_time><time datetime=2025-01-18T00:00:00+08:00>Jan 18, 2025</time></span><hr><p>I was looking back at my &ldquo;Case Of The Golden Idol&rdquo; review and I was astounded that it was written in 2023!
Anyway, the developers apparently decided to release a new game (not a DLC!) due to popular demand and I immediately bought it to give it a shot.
Spoilers ahead!</p><p>To be honest, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure why this game is sold as a separate game, than as a DLC from the original. Maybe there is an engine upgrading issue I am not aware of, and they don&rsquo;t want to risk updating the base game? Either way, the game plays mostly the same way as the first one so that felt a little&mldr;disappointing.</p><p>And it&rsquo;s not like the story is completely standalone either. I felt that the game had a lot of references to the first game. It REALLY felt like a DLC.</p><p>I think how amazed you are with the game depends on how fast you figured things out. Imagine there is a spectrum where one end is players having no clue what&rsquo;s going on, and on the other side you have players who already figured everything out before attempting the puzzles. If a player is at the ends of the spectrum, that&rsquo;s not a good thing. Clueless people will fill frustrated and people who guessed the outcome will feel bored.</p><p>I think the designers understand this very well about their game. I think that they did to elevate the previous point is to ensure that each scene is solvable on it&rsquo;s own but make it so that players cannot connect each scene to each other in an obvious way. I felt that this is a direction they consciously took differently from the first game.</p><p>For example, Chapter 1 is actually the last chapter, and any hints of that was not shown until at least the last scene in Chapter 5, so when I played the game, I was constantly confused what does any of the scene has to do with Chapter 1. To throw me off more, the scenes in are very loosely connected, especially in chapters 2 to 5. Yes, there are maybe 2 scenes that are connected, but most of them made me go &ldquo;okay yeah cool but what has this got to do with the bigger picture?&rdquo;. I felt that they overdid that&mldr;? Like some scenes really felt like fillers, even after solving them.</p><p>Man I wish I could say that this game is a 10/10, but it&rsquo;s probably a 7/10.</p></div></div></body></html>
