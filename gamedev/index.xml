Anyway, the developers apparently decided to release a new game (not a DLC!) due to popular demand and I immediately bought it to give it a shot.
Spoilers ahead!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BG3 Plans: Faylar</title><link>/gamedev/20250102_bg3_plan_faylar/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2025 13:40:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/gamedev/20250102_bg3_plan_faylar/</guid><description>&lt;p>These are plans for the character Faylar.

It brought my attention to the developer Mike Klubnika who has been making this kind of atmospheric games for awhile.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Little Nightmares</title><link>/gamedev/20240907_little_nightmares_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2024 14:44:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/gamedev/20240907_little_nightmares_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I realized that I haven&amp;rsquo;t written about Little Nightmares after playing it on stream some time ago, so here we go. I think it slipped my mind because it&amp;rsquo;s kind of difficult to describe a game like this to me. Perhaps it is because of the aesthetic direction the game took.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ghost Trick Thoughts</title><link>/gamedev/20240615_thoughts_on_ghost_trick/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2024 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/gamedev/20240615_thoughts_on_ghost_trick/</guid><description>&lt;p>After many recommendations, I finally picked up and completed Ghost Trick.

&lt;p>Now that it&amp;rsquo;s released, I played it till the end and apparently my opinions about it didn&amp;rsquo;t change much.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Persona 4 Golden</title><link>/gamedev/20231114_p4g_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 08:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/gamedev/20231114_p4g_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>This post is just going to be some ramblings I have after completing Persona 4 Golden in 2023.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get the easy stuff out of the way first. The game has amazing music, UI, art style and theme.
The team has always been excellent in these aspects and are often brought up in case studies in my classes.
With that out of the way, here are my thoughts on my playthrough.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lit Dev Postmorterm</title><link>/gamedev/20230810_primix_dev_postmorterm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 23:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/gamedev/20230810_primix_dev_postmorterm/</guid><description>&lt;p>Alright, the game is &lt;a href="https://momolabo.itch.io/lit">out on itch.io&lt;/a> for free.
This is the 2nd game I have made using a rewrite of the engine I used in &lt;a href="https://momolabo.itch.io/dots_and_circles">dots and circles&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Case of the Golden Idol</title><link>/gamedev/20230506_case_of_the_golden_idol/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 12:31:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/gamedev/20230506_case_of_the_golden_idol/</guid><description>&lt;p>After playing &amp;ldquo;Return To Obra Dinn&amp;rdquo;, a few people have asked me to look into &amp;ldquo;Case of the Golden Idol&amp;rdquo;.
It was also recommended by Lucas Pope, developer of &lt;em>Return To Obra Dinn&lt;/em>.
While waiting for my VISA in Singapore, I managed to allocate some time to play it on stream.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Return To Obra Dinn</title><link>/gamedev/20230402_return_to_obra_dinn_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2023 12:31:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/gamedev/20230402_return_to_obra_dinn_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had this game for awhile now in my Steam library, but like all games on it, I never took managed to allocate time for it until a friend speaks about it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Cyberpunk 2077</title><link>/gamedev/20230114_cyberpunk_2077_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/gamedev/20230114_cyberpunk_2077_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I finally took the time to complete Cyberpunk 2077 today.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I played an open world western RPG.
I believe the last one I played was Skyrim when it first released in 2011.
&amp;hellip;man, that was really a long time ago.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Fallout 2</title><link>/gamedev/20221217_fallout_2_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2022 14:44:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/gamedev/20221217_fallout_2_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I played Fallout 2 in 2022 and here are my thoughts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like Fallout 1, I have also played Fallout 2 as a kid. Just like Fallout 1, it&amp;rsquo;s so refreshing to play it in 2022.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Fallout 1</title><link>/gamedev/20221117_fallout_1_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 14:44:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/gamedev/20221117_fallout_1_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I played Fallout 1 in 2022 and here are my thoughts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, let me give a disclaimer and say that I have played Fallout 1 as a kid when the game is still in a CD.
I remember positive emotions playing the game but all I remembered as an adult before playing it again was that you are the Vault Dweller from Vault 13 and you need to find a water chip within some kind of a time limit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Stray</title><link>/gamedev/20220731_stray_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 13:40:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/gamedev/20220731_stray_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just played this game called &amp;lsquo;Stray&amp;rsquo; over the week just to check out what all the hype was about.
Before I go on, I would like to say that it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty decent game.
I can see why there are people who loved and hate it.
Here I&amp;rsquo;m just going to pen down thoughts I find about the game.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sorry about the word vomit in advance, and of course, spoilers from here on!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dots and Circles Dev Postmorterm</title><link>/gamedev/20211201_dots_and_circles_dev_postmorterm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 23:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>/gamedev/20211201_dots_and_circles_dev_postmorterm/</guid><description>&lt;p>Alright, the game is &lt;a href="https://momohoudai.itch.io/dots-and-circles">out on itch.io&lt;/a> for free!
